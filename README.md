This is a R Script for a german basic course in compter aided statistics with R, 
the comments and the logic are in german language 
We are dealing witha german university course of bachelor level

Summary of the R Script:

This R script demonstrates essential concepts of descriptive statistics and data manipulation using the dplyr package. The following key steps are covered:

	1.	Data Import:
	•	The dataset is imported with special handling for delimiters and decimal marks.
	2.	Descriptive Statistics:
	•	Measures of central tendency (mean and median) and measures of dispersion (standard deviation, variance, and range) are computed.
	3.	Data Manipulation with dplyr:
	•	Data is filtered based on conditions (e.g., car age greater than 50 months and value above 15,000).
	•	Grouping and summarization operations are performed to compute the mean car value for different car types.
	4.	Data Visualization:
	•	Histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and bar plots are created to visualize the distribution of variables and relationships between them.

This document provides a structured workflow for performing basic data analysis and visualization in R.
